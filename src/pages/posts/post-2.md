# 2022 Reflections
I feel almost guilty for saying this, but 2022 was the year I discovered many, many things that changed my life for the better. Particularly, for my mental health.
First, about the disasters:
## A year when bad news just keeps getting badder
War in Ukraine. Sinking economy. The din just kept getting worse, and is still getting worse. Financial pundits, real and fake, are screaming that 2023 is the YeAr WHeRe THinGs Get WOrSe cos REsseCion! It's tough to maintain mental health in this whirlwind of bad news. Then the most contentious general election in Malaysian history, which I wrote in my Substack issue, Lord Help Me, Itâ€™s Election Time. Then a complete U-turn where Anwar Ibrahim is PM10 after decades of trying. 

Anwar Ibrahim becomes prime minister. Will he last? People actually wept when this happened. I couldn't blame them. As I watch his swearing in on that fateful day, I couldn't believe what was happening. I still don't. I'll savour it while I can.
